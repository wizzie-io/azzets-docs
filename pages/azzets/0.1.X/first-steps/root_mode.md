There are two types of users, root and a Provider administrator:

1- Root:

The root and activated check boxes are marked by default, to create a root user we must select both check boxes. If you are root, you will have access to all the Providers and all the information.
At the end we click on the `SAVE` button.

{% include image.html file="azzets/createUserRoot/checkboxroot.png" alt="Create User" %}

2- Provider:  
In the event that the user we are creating is not root, we must uncheck the root checkbox and specify the Provider to which it belongs. This user will only see the data of their Provider.

Once the user's data is updated, we must create a new provider, for this we go to the `Entities / Provider` tab:
